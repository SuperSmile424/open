# Open Sauced

This is a GraphQL starter project to help people stalk open source repositories and take notes on them. This project uses Graphcool as a GraphQL backend, Apollo as the GraphQL endpoint, and Netlify to deploy. 

The data fetching from GitHub uses their GraphQL Early Access API
exclusively.
